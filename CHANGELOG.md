## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- `ContractRelations` model — computed at contract build time from ADR frontmatter; provides forward indexes (`depends_on`, `related_to`, `supersedes`), reverse indexes (`required_by`, `related_from`, `superseded_by`), supersession chains (`[oldest → newest]`), and clause lookup tables (`clause_to_adr`, `adr_to_clauses`); attached as `relations` field on `ConstraintsContract` and excluded from the content hash
- Relationship surfacing in `adr_planning_context` — each ADR in `relevant_adrs` now includes a `relations` dict with its per-ADR relationship context; the response also includes a top-level `relations_summary` with the full global relationship indexes for the contract
- Scenario taxonomy for `adr_planning_context` — four named scenarios (`strategic_planning`, `focused_implementation`, `pre_decision`, `supersession_impact`) replace the previous free-text `context_type` field; each scenario produces a different projection of the architecture contract
- `ContextRequest` model — structured request contract with typed `scope_hints`, `change_mode`, `detail_level`, and `known_targets`; existing callers passing only `task_description` continue to work unchanged (defaults to `strategic_planning`)
- `ScenarioContextPacket` response model — scenario-aware response shape with `overview`, ranked `constraints`, `warnings`, and `inspect_deeper` references to ADRs and clauses for progressive disclosure
- `OutputMode` enum (`native_config`, `native_rules`, `generated_checker`, `policy_file`, `script_fallback`) and `EnforcementStage` enum (`commit`, `push`, `ci`) — enforcement adapters now declare what kind of artifact they emit and at which gate it is evaluated, making the enforcement plane's output taxonomy explicit and inspectable
- `FallbackAdapter` — unroutable policy keys now flow through a standard adapter interface rather than a pipeline side path; fallback promptlets appear in `EnforcementResult.fragments_applied` with `output_mode="script_fallback"` alongside native-config fragments, making the full enforcement picture visible in one place
- `output_mode` field on `EnforcementResult.fragments_applied` entries — each applied fragment now reports its output mode, enabling callers to distinguish native enforcement artifacts from agent-authored validation scripts
- `depends_on` and `related_to` optional fields on ADR frontmatter — declare inter-ADR dependencies and relationships directly in the ADR file; the contract builder warns when referenced ADR IDs cannot be resolved
- Mypy enforcement adapter — approving an ADR with `config_enforcement.python.mypy` constraints automatically generates a `.mypy-adr.ini` configuration file
- TypeScript tsconfig enforcement adapter — approving an ADR with `config_enforcement.typescript.tsconfig` constraints automatically generates a `tsconfig.adr.json` file that can be extended via tsconfig's `extends`
- Import-linter enforcement adapter — approving an ADR with `architecture.layer_boundaries` constraints automatically generates an `.importlinter-adr` configuration file for Python architectural boundary enforcement
- INI conflict detection — `ConflictDetector` now detects contradictions between adapter-generated INI fragments and existing user config on disk (supports mypy and import-linter targets)
- `ConflictDetector` — detects two classes of enforcement conflicts: (1) policy-contract conflicts (new ADR policy contradicts existing contract, e.g. one ADR allows Flask while another bans it) and (2) fragment-config conflicts (adapter-generated fragment contradicts existing user config on disk). Policy conflict detection is reusable by decision-plane workflows for pre-approval validation
- Guided fallback for unroutable policies — when no adapter can handle a policy key, the pipeline generates a structured promptlet instructing the agent to create a validation script, rather than silently dropping the policy. Scripts placed in `scripts/adr-validations/` are treated as first-class enforcement artifacts
- Enforcement metadata in `_build_policy_reference()` — creation workflow now shows agents which policy keys have native adapter coverage (and which tool), which fall back to scripts, and which have no enforcement path yet. Metadata is derived live from the adapter registry so creation guidance stays in sync as adapters are added
- Conflict pipeline wiring — `EnforcementPipeline.compile()` now collects all fragments before writing, runs conflict detection, writes only conflict-free fragments, and surfaces conflicting ones in `EnforcementResult.conflicts` with full context (adapter, description, implicated policy keys)
- Canonical enforcement pipeline (`EnforcementPipeline`) — single entry point for all enforcement that reads exclusively from the compiled architecture contract, never from raw ADR files
- `EnforcementResult` audit envelope produced on every ADR approval: tracks which config fragments were applied, which adapters were skipped and why, any conflicts detected, clause-level provenance, and an idempotency hash (same contract → identical hash)
- Contract-driven ESLint adapter (`generate_eslint_config_from_contract`) — generates `no-restricted-imports` rules directly from compiled `MergedConstraints`
- Contract-driven Ruff adapter (`generate_ruff_config_from_contract`) — generates `banned-from` rules from compiled Python and import constraints
- `clause_id` field on every provenance entry — deterministic 12-char identifier (`sha256(adr_id:rule_path)[:12]`) enabling clause-level traceability from enforcement artifacts back to source ADRs
- Topological sort in policy merger — ADRs are now ordered by supersession relationships (Kahn's algorithm) before merging, so superseding ADRs correctly override their predecessors; falls back to date sort when no supersession relationships exist
- `CHANGELOG.md` with full version history
- `TECHNICAL.md` with implementation details for each layer
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development environment setup
- `SECURITY.md` with supported versions and vulnerability reporting
- Release CI workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) with PyPI Trusted Publishing and automated GitHub Release creation
- "Releasing" section in `CLAUDE.md` documenting the tag-based release process
- Staged enforcement pipeline: `adr-kit enforce <level>` validates ADR policies at commit, push, and CI stages
- `adr-kit setup-enforcement` command for configuring git hooks
- `adr-kit enforce-status` command for viewing enforcement configuration
- `--with-enforcement` flag on `adr-kit init` for one-step git hook setup
- Enforcement classifier maps ADR policy types to enforcement levels (commit/push/CI)
- `StagedValidator` runs classified checks against staged, changed, or all files per enforcement level
- `HookGenerator` creates pre-commit and pre-push git hooks with managed sections (idempotent, non-interfering)
- JSON enforcement reporter (`--format json`) with AI-readable `EnforcementReport` schema
- Architecture layer boundary enforcement at push level
- Standalone validation script generator (`adr-kit generate-scripts`) — creates stdlib-only Python scripts from ADR policies with `--quick` and `--full` modes
- CI workflow generator (`adr-kit generate-ci`) — creates GitHub Actions YAML for ADR enforcement on pull requests
- Approval workflow auto-generates validation scripts for newly approved ADRs
- Importance-weighted ranking in `adr_planning_context` — centrality, policy richness, tag breadth, and status penalties applied as multiplicative boost on relevance scores
- Individual ADR MCP resources (`adr://{adr_id}`) for progressive disclosure — agents fetch full ADR content on demand via `resource_uri` field

### Changed
- Internal module structure reorganized into three planes: `decision/` (workflows, gate, guidance) and `enforcement/` (adapters, validation, generation, config, detection, reporter) — no public API changes
- README rewritten for user focus: problem statement, quick start, tool reference, FAQ
- `ROADMAP.md` "Recent Additions" section replaced with link to this changelog
- CI workflow consolidated from 13 to 8 checks: dedicated lint job (blocks tests), trimmed test matrix to `(ubuntu + macOS) × (3.11–3.13) + ubuntu-only 3.10`

### Fixed
- `pyproject.toml` project URLs updated from placeholder `your-org` to correct `kschlt`
- Added Python 3.13 classifier to package metadata
- `mcp-health` now shows detected version at startup and joins update thread for in-order notification

### Removed
- `PolicyPatternExtractor` and regex-based policy extraction — replaced by agent reasoning approach

---

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Decision quality guidance system: two-phase ADR creation with structured reasoning steps, quality criteria, and anti-pattern examples
- Pre-validation quality gate: quality check runs before file creation, enabling correction loop without partial files — ADRs below B-grade threshold (75 pts) return `REQUIRES_ACTION` with improvement guidance
- `skip_quality_gate` parameter on `adr_create` for test overrides
- Pattern policy models (`PatternRule`, `PatternPolicy`) with JSON schema
- Architecture policy models (`LayerBoundaryRule`, `RequiredStructure`, `ArchitecturePolicy`) with JSON schema
- Config enforcement models (`TypeScriptConfig`, `PythonConfig`, `ConfigEnforcementPolicy`) with JSON schema
- `adr_create` policy suggestion engine: auto-detects policy candidates from decision text and returns a structured promptlet guiding policy construction
- AI warning extraction in `adr_planning_context`: consequences containing warnings are surfaced for relevant decisions
- Domain filtering in `adr_planning_context` for 60–80% context reduction

### Changed
- Integration test architecture: replaced ~308 lines of regex extraction with a reasoning-agent promptlet. Agents reason about policies from their own decision text rather than ADR Kit extracting via pattern matching
- MCP tool documentation moved from static docstrings to just-in-time response payloads (context-efficient ping-pong pattern)

### Fixed
- `adr_create` content generation simplified to prevent empty sections

---

## [0.2.6] - 2025-12-15

- Constraint extraction guide and example ADR fixtures
- MCP server configuration for development (`.mcp.json`)
- Middleware to fix stringified JSON parameters from buggy MCP clients

### Changed
- Project structure refactored and developer documentation improved
- Version read dynamically from package metadata

### Fixed
- CLI version detection with semantic comparison
- `uv run` prefix added to all Makefile tool commands

---

## [0.2.5] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- Python 3.10 compatibility fixes (`datetime.timezone.utc`)

### Changed
- Migrated from pipx to uv for package installation
- CI Python version matrix updated to match package requirements (`3.10+`)
- `setup-uv` action upgraded from v4 to v6

### Fixed
